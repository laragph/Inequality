<h1>New York has a major wealth distribution problem</h1>
<h2>by Lara Heard</h2>
<p>Income inequality in New York City is a threat, and it's only been exacerbated by the pandemic.</p>
<p>Despite having a lower poverty rate than some of the other most populous cities in the United States, New York still has a major issue with wealth distribution. As of 2019, <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/205637/percentage-of-poor-people-in-the-top-20-most-populated-cities-in-the-us/">16% of the population</a> lived below the poverty line. </p>
<p>But even though about one in six New Yorkers is living in poverty, the city has plenty of wealthy residents. A 2018 <a href="https://www.wealthx.com/report/high-net-worth-handbook-2019/?utm_campaign=HNWH2019&amp;amp;utm_source=broadcast&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_term=hnwh-2019-press&amp;amp;utm_source=broadcast&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral#downloadform">Wealth-X report</a> found that the city houses more high net worth residents than any other globally.</p>

<p>Data from the American Community Survey shows that this inequality is especially high in Manhattan, where per capita income in the borough's FIPS codes ranges from below $20,000 to above $250,000. And in a city as expensive as New York, every penny counts. Matters have only become worse over COVID-19's trajectory. Food banks have dramatically increased the number of meals served and unemployment has increased. While about 49% of New York employees' employment income decreased<a href="https://www.robinhood.org/wp-content/themes/robinhood/images/poverty-tracker/pdfs/POVERTY_TRACKER_REPORT24.pdf"> according to a February 2021 report</a> after March 2020, this number was greater (57%) for low-wage employees.
<p>As New York greets cultural milestones in the battle against the virus, including the resurgance of Broadway and upcoming New Years celebrations, many New Yorkers continue to struggle, making wages that fall short of the city's monetary demands.</div>
